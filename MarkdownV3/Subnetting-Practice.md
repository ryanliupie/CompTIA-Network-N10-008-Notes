## Subnetting 

<p>
  The way I learned was from <a href="https://www.practicalnetworking.net/stand-alone/subnetting-mastery/"> Practical Subnetting </a> and you can follow his videos as well!

  I recommend practicing over and over as it will become much easier to do when the exam comes or in general when you need to subnet in the workplace.

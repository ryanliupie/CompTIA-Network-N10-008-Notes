# Network N10-008 Exam Notes
<hr>

## Welcome
<p> Hello, I am currently pursuing the CompTIA Network + exam and hope to take it soon. Down below you can click on each markdown to review the objectives â‡“ . Feel free to use them in your studies (if you can read my hand writing) and contact via email if you have any questions! </p>

<p> These notes derive from Professor Messer's Youtube Course, LLM (chatGPT), and Cisco's Networking basics. I also purchased Jason Dion's practice exams to further my studies and used ExamCompass </p>
  
<p> I will not be displaying any paid material here as they have worked extremely hard to put amazing information where you and I can learn from. I highly suggest you to support these creators during your studies! </p>

# Network+ N10-008 Exam Notes üìñ ‚úîÔ∏è 
<hr>

## Welcome
<p> 
  Hello, I am currently pursuing the CompTIA Network + exam and hope to take it soon. Down below you can click on each markdown to review the objectives ‚áì . Feel free to use them in your studies (if you can read my hand writing) and contact via email if    you have any questions! 
</p>

<p> 
  These notes derive from <a href ="https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/n10-008-training-course/"> Professor Messor </a>, LLM (chatGPT), and <a href ="https://www.netacad.com/"> Cisco Skills For All </a>.  I also purchased     Jason Dion's practice exams to further my studies with the additon of ExamCompass. Lastly, one big factor was the CompTIA community on reddit helping each other with the material! 
</p>
  
<p> 
  I will not be displaying any paid material here as these instructors have worked extremely hard to put out amazing information where you and I can learn from. I highly suggest you to support these creators during your studies!

## How To Study? üéß‚òï
<p> 
  It‚Äôs important not just to write everything down, but to really understand what you‚Äôre writing. Put the information in your own words, making sure you truly grasp the concept. This might sound typical, but it‚Äôs key to retaining knowledge.
  
  If you don‚Äôt fully understand a topic, check out different resources that explain it from another perspective. Once you understand it, try applying the knowledge in real-world situations.

  For instance, if you're trying to learn about Coaxial or Ethernet cables, physically interact with your "networking gear" and observe them. If you don‚Äôt have access to the actual cables, either buy some or apply those concepts to familiar ideas. 
  
  For example, I think of bandwidth like a bowl: the bigger the bowl, the more data it can carry. Throughput, on the other hand, is the actual amount of data being transmitted, which may not fill the bowl (milk) completely due to network congestion (the    cereal) or there is a lack of data (milk) .

# Network N10-008 Exam Notes
<hr>

## Welcome
<p> Hello, I am currently pursuing the CompTIA Network + exam and hope to take it soon. Down below you can click on each markdown to review the objectives ⇓ . Feel free to use them in your studies (if you can read my hand writing) and contact via email if you have any questions! 
</p>

<p> These notes derive from Professor Messer's Youtube Course, LLM (chatGPT), and Cisco's Networking basics. I also purchased Jason Dion's practice exams to further my studies with the additon of ExamCompass. 
</p>
  
<p> I will not be displaying any paid material here as these instructors have worked extremely hard to put out amazing information where you and I can learn from. I highly suggest you to support these creators during your studies!

## How To Study? 
<p> It's important that you do not just write everything down. Understand what you are writing and put it in your own words that you can understand. It sounds typical but it's the foundation in retaining information. For example, if you do not understand a certain top, check other resources that can explain the topic in a different way.
